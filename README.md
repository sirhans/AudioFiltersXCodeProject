# XCode project for testing the Blue Mangoo signal processing toolbox

This repo contains an XCode project with the Blue Mangoo signal processing toolbox linked as a git submodule. We use it for testing the signal processing components in a console enviornment.
We make this code freely available to all who can find a use for it.

The only significant code in this project is the main.c that we use to call test functions in the signal processing toolbox. All the signal processing code is contained within the submodule at this repo: https://github.com/sirhans/AudioFiltersSubmodule
